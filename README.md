# HTML to Jekyll Sample 🌏 🧪
> A demo to showcase converting a plain HTML site to a Jekyll site


## Tutorial content

I created this repo during this 1-hour live session I did on YouTube:

- [Jekyll live coding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v5vEBUmkGs)

The intention was to take an existing site with content and styling and build a Jekyll site out of it.

I found that this one on CodePen was suitable.

- [Asperion HTML5 template](https://codepen.io/alexdevero/pen/GCirD)

I've copied the rendered content to [sample.html](/sample.html) as well to make it easier to compare or in case the pen disappears.

I cleaned up the code after the live session and upload it as this repo.
