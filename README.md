## Tutorial

### YouTube video

My intention was to take an existing site with content and styling and build a Jekyll site out of it.

I hosted a live session on YouTube to do just that. It is available as a recording.

- [Jekyll live coding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v5vEBUmkGs)

This repo was created from scratch in that session. I encourage you to watch that video and compare it with this repo.

### Choosing an HTML base

I found this article of 99 free HTML templates.

- [99 Free HTML Templates You Can Download Right Now](https://html.com/resources/free-html-templates/)

The first option on that list is this CodePen, which I liked.

- [Asperion HTML5 template](https://codepen.io/alexdevero/pen/GCirD) by [Alex Devero](http://alexdevero.com) / [@alexdevero](https://github.com/alexdevero).

So I used that for the tutorial.

It has "template" in the name, so I feel comfortable that the creator indended the code to be reused by others.

### Upload repo

I cleaned up the code after the live session and upload it as this repo. This is a demo or sample which supplements the tutorial video.

I also copied the rendered content to [sample.html](/sample.html) as well to make it easier to compare the Jekyll site against it and in case the pen disappears.
