# HTML to Jekyll Sample
> A demo to showcase converting a plain HTML site to a Jekyll site

This project was built using this template project on CodePen:

- [Asperion HTML5 template](https://codepen.io/alexdevero/pen/GCirD)

I've copied the rendered content to [sample.html](/sample.html) as well to make it easier to compare or in case the pen disappears.
